'''Manbearpig3130's Virtual Gaming Machine:'''
Hardware:
* '''CPU''': Intel Core i7-6850K
* '''Motherboard''': Gigabyte x99-Ultra Gaming-CF (Revision 1.0, BIOS/UEFI Version: F4)
* '''Host GPU''': AMD Radeon HD6950
* '''Guest GPU''': AMD R9 390
* '''RAM''': 32GB G-Skill Ripjaws DDR4 3333MHz

Configuration:
* '''Host Kernel''': Kernel version Linux 4.7.2-1 (No ACS patch).
* Using '''libvirt QEMU/KVM with OVMF''': link to domain XMLs/scripts/notes: https://github.com/manbearpig3130/MBP-VT-d-gaming-machine
* '''Host OS''': Arch Linux
* '''Guest OS''': Windows 10 Pro
* 2x 480GB SSDs set up in LVM striped mode formatted to ext4 are mounted in linux which contains the guest's qcow2 virtual VirtIO disk.
* USB Host controller is passed through, giving most USB ports to the VM, leaving my USB 3.1 controller with attached USB hub for the host.
* Motherboard has two NICs, one is passed into VM (Works after installing Killer NIC Driver).
* To get HDMI audio working in windows I have to roll back the HDMI audio drivers from AMD back to the default Windows driver in device manager for some reason.
* Sometimes doesn't boot properly, and have to restart the VM, sometimes a few times before it boots properly. I think it may have something to do with how Windows handles shutdown?
* VM gets dedicated 16GB RAM via static hugepages.
* CPU pinning increased performance considerably.
* Windows boots straight into Steam big picture mode on it's primary display (43" Sony Bravia). Overall 
an awesome gaming machine that meets my gaming needs and lust for GNU/Linux at the same time.
